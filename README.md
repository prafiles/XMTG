XMTG
====
XMTG is a software to translate XMT C to other languages. 
This project is a part of ongoing research paper.
Tested Visual Studio 2012 Windows 7 and Ubuntu 13.10 GCC 4.8

XMTC is a flexible and easy parallel language based on PRAM which results in great flexibility as per the I/O. However current parallel architectures offer great power but with great programmer effort and complexity. This software aids to minimize this gap.

Use the provided Solution file for Windows. Make for Unix is not provided at the moment though simply compile XMTG.cpp with clang++ or g++.
